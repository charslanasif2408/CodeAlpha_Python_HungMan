# CodeAlpha_Python_HungMan_Game
TASK 1: Hangman Game
Objective:
Create a console-based word guessing game where the user guesses one letter at a time.
Key Concepts Used:
random for selecting a word
while loop for game logic
if-else for conditions
lists and strings for word tracking
How It Works:
A word is randomly chosen from a predefined list.
The user has to guess the word by guessing one letter at a time.
For each wrong guess, chances decrease.
The game ends if the word is guessed correctly or the user runs out of attempts.
Sample Output:
Word: _ _ _ _ _Wrong guesses left: 6Enter a letter: aâœ… Good guess!
